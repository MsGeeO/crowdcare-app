# Crowd-Care-Web-App
This Portfolio Project for @HolbertonSchool Software Engineering Program offered by ALX Africa, is my final project for the ALX Software Engineering Programme. It was born out of a need pointed out during our church's worker's congress about a crowd control mechanism during our annual outreach program held at Abuja, Nigeria. This led to me seeking a way to minimize the accident, stampede occurences during the said outreach as this is not the intention of our senior pastors and the entire organizers.

This application not only endeavors to act as a comprehensive solution for effective crowd control but also strives to enhance the management of large gatherings by seamlessly integrating technology into the process.

The primary objective is to bridge the gap between event organizers and attendees, thus ensuring smoother and more engaging crowd control. Through the embrace of cutting-edge technology, Crowd-Care aims to empower event planners.

# Getting Started with creating react app
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
### `npm run build` fails to minify
This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)


# Challenges
+ Time constraint
+ Loads of debugging and debugging
+ Tried different deploying methods
+ I think I wrote a really complex code work initially, like it was my first time writing a react app, and I'm glad it worked.

# Achievements
I successfully wrote a react web app that worked! Yeahhhhhh!!!!
Like ALX would say "DO HARD THINGS". I actually did!!!

# Resources/ Contributions
